## About Me

Based in Las Vegas, NV — where the servers run hot and the coffee runs hotter.  
AI Architect by trade, musician by passion, and reluctant adult by necessity.  
Currently building fintech, computer vision, and simulation AI systems that might accidentally pass the Turing Test (and HR screening).

## Achievements

- Built 3 startups, broke 4 production servers, survived 5 existential crises.

- Created a human child who already writes cleaner code than some engineers I’ve worked with.

## Fun Facts

- Believes `console.log` is a lifestyle.  
- Deletes `node_modules` like it’s an act of repentance.  
- Once explained GPTs to his therapist. She quit.  
- Favorite debugging strategy: panic, pray, and rewrite from scratch.  
- Motto: *It’s not a bug — it’s an undocumented feature of the simulation.*
