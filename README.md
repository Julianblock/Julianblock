## 🧠 About Me

- Based in Las Vegas, NV — where the code compiles and the dreams die.  
- AI Architect by day, existential crisis machine by night.  
- Wannabe musician, part-time mathematician, full-time disaster recovery plan.  
- Currently building **fintech**, **computer vision**, and **simulation AIs** that may or may not become self-aware.

## 🚀 Founder Of

| Project | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Vivvy.ai** | Turns bad Yelp reviews into corporate enlightenment using GPT. |
| **Dreamcatcher** | Reads your dreams, judges your life choices, and occasionally gaslights you. |
| **Project LUX∞** | A simulation of light, time, and poor decision-making. Basically quantum physics but sassier. |

## 🧩 Core Focus Areas

- **AI / LLM Systems:** GPT-4, Mistral, LangChain, RAG pipelines, and hallucinations (the model’s and mine).  
- **Infra & Backend:** FastAPI, Docker, Supabase, and whatever cloud service just raised prices again.  
- **Scientific Computing:** Simulating photons and explaining it to people who stopped listening two minutes ago.

## 🛠 Toolbox

## 🏆 Achievements

- Built 3 startups, broke 4 production servers, and survived 5 existential crises.  
- Released 6 albums as *The American Sandman* because therapy is expensive.  
- Made a child who already has better debugging instincts than most dev teams.

## 🎭 Fun Facts

- Believes `console.log` is a valid debugging strategy.  
- Deletes `node_modules` like it’s a cleansing ritual.  
- Has strong opinions about semicolons and even stronger regrets.  
- Once explained GPTs to his therapist — she quit.  
- Motto: “It’s not a bug, it’s a feature we don’t fully understand yet.”
